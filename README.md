# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is commonly used for binary classification problems.

This notebook includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Accuracy and performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of medical diagnostic measurements for females aged 21 and above. Key features include:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## 🧪 Model(s) Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report used for evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results

The models were trained and tested with a split of 80/20. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1-score help measure prediction performance.
